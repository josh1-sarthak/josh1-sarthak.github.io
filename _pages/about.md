### about me

![](prof.jpg)

Hi! I'm Sarthak Joshi and I work as a software engineer specializing
in Front End. My workplace base location is in Bangalore, India, though I've been working
in a remote/hybrid mode since quite a while. Orginally, I hail from hilly region of Nainital, Uttarakhand, India.

### tech stack

* **Holy Trinity**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript to control layout, design and behavior respectively.
* **TypeScript**: for static typing and to prevent unforseen bugs.
* **Front End Ecosystem**: React; component libraries - Semantic UI, Fluent UI; state management - Redux, context, redux toolkit; hooks.
* **Testing**: jest, jasmine.
* **Cloud**: Azure, AWS.
* **Backend**: firebase, node.


### interests

Things that Interest me:
* Geography. I love to know more about different places and their culture, traditions.
* Basketball. My favorite sport since a highschooler.
* Foreign media. I've dabbled in multiple asian and european movies/series/sitcoms, just out of keen interest in their media. Though nothing substantial came out of it, but I'm glad it has broadened my perspective. Though I must say, in terms of genre, I always love the horror/thriller, the sheer surge in adrenaline is incomparable.
* Web programming in general.
